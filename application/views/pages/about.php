    GLOBAL TUTORS is an online educational enrichment center created to linking quality tutors with students who are looking to attend educational institutions overseas.  What makes Globaltutors unique compared to other tutorial services is the fact we pride ourselves in providing our students top quality tutors who have gained degrees from the major universities in their respective countries.   In addition, our tutors are equipped with the latest web based tutorial tools, such as video chat, interactive learning center, and share screen to enhance the tutorial experience between tutor and student.  Our purpose is bridge the distance and cultural barriers by allowing the student the option to choose who they learn from vs. settling with what they are provided in their reach.   For example: the local tutorial center teachers large amounts of kids at one time and he is from 1 college.  With global tutors: you can learn from an equally qualified tutor, it will be one on one tutoring + he/she will be from the area that you choose to attend college at.  Globaltutors enhances tutor / student relationships by matching the tutors / students based on personality and preferences, an application that has never been applied before.  We serve students in elementary through high school students and our focus is set around core academic subjects and test preparation.

As of right now our tutors are primarily based in Uk, Canada, AU, and US, but as we grow we will have tutors in other regions.
